trying to optimize strain and thrust (max thrust, min strain)

constants, pressure anf density, Vin (initial velocity), pressure 

presssure (height, temperature)
density (heigth, temp)

Vin is a constant

rpm is a constahr too, 40k]

]




inputa
- prop diameter, with RPM get cyclic airspeed
- pitch


output:
- efficiency of thrust
- strain on blade, yoeld stress for carbon fiberm, include ibti fcn as a penalty

constrained vs unconstrained algorithms

make a framework where we can experiment with different modeld

yield stress for carbon fiber penalty
